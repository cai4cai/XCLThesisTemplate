%USAGE:

%\bibliographystyle{mybstfile}
%\bibliography{IEEEfull,mybibfile}

%where the IEEE titles in the .bib database entries use the strings
%defined here. e.g.,


%   journal = IEEE_J_AC,


%to yield "{IEEE} Transactions on Automatic Control"


%WARNING: IEEE uses abbreviated journal titles in their bibliographies!
%Because this file provides the full titles, you should NOT use this file
%for work that is to be submitted to the IEEE.

%For IEEE work, you should use the abbreviated titles provided in the
%companion file, IEEEabrv.bib.


%** NOTES **

% 1. Journals have been grouped according to subject in order to make it
%    easier to locate and extract the definitions for related journals -
%    as most works use references that are confined to a single topic.
%    Magazines are listed in straight alphabetical order.

% 2. String names are closely based on IEEE's own internal acronyms.

% 3. Older, out-of-print IEEE titles are included (but not including titles
%    dating prior to IEEE's formation from the IRE and AIEE in 1963).
